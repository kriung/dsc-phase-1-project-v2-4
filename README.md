# MOVIE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
### AUTHOR: KEVIN RIUNGU
### INTRODUCTION
The task at hand is to assist Microsoft to make inroads into the Movie industry. The major goal was to explore What type of films are currently doing the best in the market and to provide these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives. My analysis approach targeted utilization of descriptive statistics and visualizations from provided data sets.

### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
Microsoft wants to venture into the profitable movie making industry but they seek credible market research in order to have clear insights before they jump into the market. To assist them in this endavour i have been looking at data provided by various sources in order to unearth movies that perform well in the market currently. By analyzing the movies that have been most successful recently i can make tangible recommendations about which movies the company should target in order to realize optimum revenues. After carefully considering the business problem and combing through the data provided, I have come up with the following questions that will guide the course of my analysis:

#### 1 What type of movies are currently most successful.
#### 2 Movie Genre preference: How are different movie genres recieved by different audiences
#### 3 Which movie genres are more financially successful

### DATA UNDERSTANDING
Data used in this project was cited from various sources; namely:-

Box office Mojo
Box Office Mojo is a popular website that tracks box office revenue for movies.

IMDB
IMDb, or the Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content.

Rotten Tomatoes
Rotten Tomatoes is a website that aggregates reviews and provides a numerical score based on the percentage of critics who have given a favorable review for movies, TV shows, and sometimes other forms of media

The Movie DB
The Movie Database (TMDb) is an online database that provides information about movies, TV shows, and celebrities.

The Numbers
The Numbers is a website that focuses on providing detailed financial information and box office data for movies. It offers comprehensive information on box office earnings, budgets, production costs, and revenue generated by films worldwide.

Understanding the landscape of successful films in the box office requires a deep dive into multiple datasets. With Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers at our disposal, we have a rich pool of information to explore. To guide Microsoft's new movie studio, I embarked on an exploratory journey, aiming to provide actionable insights for creating successful films.

### Presentation Highlights:
Understanding Box Office Success:
Visualizing Box Office Trends: I utilized Box Office Mojo and The Numbers data to create intuitive graphs showcasing trends in box office revenues over time. This sheds light on what genres or film types tend to perform well financially.
### Analyzing Audience Preferences:
Genre Preference Across Platforms: Using data from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB, I crafted visualizations to demonstrate how different genres are received by audiences. This analysis could help in gauging the potential audience engagement for specific genres.
### Profitability and Critical Reception:
Correlation between Ratings and Revenue: By juxtaposing ratings from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes against box office revenues, I uncovered patterns in the relationship between critical reception and financial success.
### Recommendations:
#### Genre Selection: 
Based on the data, I recommend focusing on genres that consistently perform well at the box office and also receive positive ratings from audiences. Action and Adventure genres, for instance, have shown both financial success and positive reception, indicating a promising avenue for Microsoft's movie studio.

#### Investment Strategy: 
Consider allocating budget and resources judiciously by leveraging insights into high-performing genres. Allocate larger budgets for genres that historically yield higher box office revenues while balancing risk with potential rewards for niche or emerging genres.

#### Audience: 
Tailor movie themes and narratives based on audience preferences highlighted in the data. Crafting stories that resonate with viewers, particularly in the favored genres, can increase the likelihood of box office success.

Jupyter Notebook:
The notebook contains detailed step-by-step exploratory analysis, including data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical insights, ensuring transparency in the process.
GitHub Repository:
The repository hosts all the code, data sources, and necessary files used in the analysis, promoting reproducibility and allowing for future enhancements or additional analysis.
By marrying financial performance with audience reception, these recommendations aim to guide Microsoft's new movie studio toward creating impactful and successful films in an ever-evolving market.
