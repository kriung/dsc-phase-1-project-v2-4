MOVIE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
AUTHOR: KEVIN RIUNGU
INTRODUCTION
The task at hand is to assist Microsoft to make inroads into the Movie industry. The major goal was to explore What type of films are currently doing the best in the market and to provide these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives. My analysis approach targeted utilization of descriptive statistics and visualizations from provided data sets.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
Microsoft wants to venture into the profitable movie making industry but they seek credible market research in order to have clear insights before they jump into the market. To assist them in this endavour i have been looking at data provided by various sources in order to unearth movies that perform well in the market currently. By analyzing the movies that have been most successful recently i can make tangible recommendations about which movies the company should target in order to realize optimum revenues. After carefully considering the business problem and combing through the data provided, I have come up with the following questions that will guide the course of my analysis:

1 What type of movies are currently most successful.
2 Is there better time of year to release a movie
3 The budget: How much the company should sink in in terms of dollars ($) in order to achieve optimum revenues
